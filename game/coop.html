            <h1>FA Coop Campaign & Custom Missions</h1>
            <p class="Coop-Info-Para">FAF has implemented the co-op feature into the campaign. This means now you can play either of the four original campaigns with up to three friends (four players)! But! That's not all, FAF contributors are also working on creating two new campaigns! One for Seraphim and another one for the coalition! However, be warned that the new campaigns are meant to present a real challenge to seasoned players. If you need some help or have questions, feel free joining the FAF Campaign Development Discord or the FAF Discord!</p>
